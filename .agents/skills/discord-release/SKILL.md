# Discord & GitHub Release Pipeline for Felaris

Builds and verifies Felaris, publishes GitHub release assets, and announces the
Windows installer in Discord `#felaris-releases`.

## Artifact selection

Discord distributes `target/release/felaris-setup.exe`. The notifier attaches it
when it exists and is at most 10 MiB. Otherwise, including `--no-upload`, it links
to `felaris-setup.exe` on the matching GitHub release. Verify that asset exists
before announcing a link, especially with `--skip-github` or a notification-only
request. Use `--installer <path>` for a custom installer location; `--exe` remains
a compatibility alias and must also receive an installer.

GitHub retains `felaris.exe`, `felaris-setup.exe`, and `SHA256SUMS`. Keep the raw
`felaris.exe` asset and `version.json` download URL for the built-in auto-updater.
Discord's download and installation instructions use `felaris-setup.exe`.

## Quick Commands

| Action | Command |
|---|---|
| **Prepare release notes before committing** | `python scripts/build.py --prepare -s "Release summary"` |
| **Build & Publish Release (GitHub + Discord)** | `python scripts/build.py` (or `.\scripts\build.ps1`) |
| **Build & Publish Discord only (skip GitHub)** | `python scripts/build.py --skip-github` |
| **Build without Discord notification** | `python scripts/build.py --skip-discord` |
| **Notify/Upload existing build manually** | `python scripts/notify_discord.py -s "Changelog summary"` |
| **Test webhook connection** | `python scripts/notify_discord.py --test` |
| **Dry run (inspect payload without sending)** | `python scripts/build.py --dry-run` |

## Direct release workflow

A release request authorizes preparing and pushing the release metadata directly
to `main`, publishing the GitHub release, and sending its Discord announcement.
Create a release PR only when the user explicitly requests one. A notification-only
request uses the existing release without a version bump or rebuild.

1. Fetch `origin/main` and prepare the release from that commit, preserving unrelated
   edits and worktrees. The release includes application changes already on `main`.
2. Use Python 3.11+. Set the version in `Cargo.toml`, update `Cargo.lock`, and run
   `python scripts/build.py --prepare -s "Release summary"` to write `version.json`.
   Commit only those three release metadata files on top of the fetched main commit.
3. Push that commit directly with `git push origin HEAD:main`, using a normal
   fast-forward push. If main advances, integrate it and review the combined changes
   before retrying. If repository rules reject direct pushes, report the rejection;
   a PR is not an automatic fallback.
4. Wait for successful Windows push CI on the exact current `origin/main` SHA.
   From a clean checkout of that commit, run `python scripts/build.py --dry-run`,
   then `python scripts/build.py` to package, publish GitHub assets, and notify Discord.
5. Verify the tag points to the release commit and all three assets are uploaded.
   Inspect `python scripts/notify_discord.py --dry-run` before a manual announcement.
   Confirm Discord returned a message ID and that the message attaches
   `felaris-setup.exe` or links to that installer on the matching release. Retain
   the release URL and message ID in the result.

GitHub publication reads committed metadata, verifies the package, and pins the tag
to that SHA. GitHub failures stop the Discord announcement; `--skip-github` is the
explicit Discord-only path. Preparation and publication are separate commands;
`--dry-run` validates without building or publishing.

## Webhook Configuration

- The webhook URL is resolved in order from:
  1. `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable
  2. `scripts/discord_webhook.txt` or `discord_webhook.txt` (excluded in `.gitignore`)
  3. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Felaris\discord_webhook.txt` (shared across all git worktrees)
- **Security Rule**: Never commit `discord_webhook.txt`.
- Channel: `#felaris-releases` (`1561759599609258109`) in the Felary Discord server.
